# 🤖 AI Content Generator

[![Deploy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Live-blue)](https://aicongen.byteunite.dev/)

A React-based application for generating content and images from visual templates using AI. Built with Vite, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components, featuring a masonry gallery for browsing and uploading templates.

## 📋 About the Project

This project lets users explore a gallery of visual templates. Upload your own images to create AI-generated templates, select one, add a topic, and generate customized content and new images based on the template.

## 🔄 How it Works

1. **📤 Upload Templates**: Upload an image, and AI analyzes it to create a reusable template with design elements and a customizable prompt.
2. **🖼️ Browse and Select**: View templates in a responsive masonry gallery. Hover for previews and click to select.
3. **✏️ Customize and Generate**: Enter a topic. AI adjusts the prompt and generates content (text) and eventually a new image matching the template style.
4. **🧠 AI-Powered Process**: Everything uses AI – from template creation to content and image generation.
